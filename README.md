# Typing capture and record
Hooking keyboard event and capture, if specific window is focused (on foreground)  
First, run autocap.py and type which window you want to capture (as a int, this is hwnd)  
Then, 1. if window is focused.  2. if there is any keyboard input event.  
Program will capture your whole screen (note that this is not window caputure)  

If you finshed, stop program and run converter.py  
This will convert your caputures to mp4 file (You need ffmpeg first)  
  
Enjoy :)
